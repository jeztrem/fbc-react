            Mark is currently the Executive Director of Interserve USA andis determined to follow Christ wherever he leads
            and to invite others to do the same. His own trek has
            taken him from entrepreneur to pastor to global ambassador. Mark launched an IT consulting business and pastored
            a church in Minnesota before moving with his family to Ukraine. There he taught business at a university,
            started a school for English learners, and began a church. That small church then trained and sent a hundred
            believers out as ambassadors for Jesus. Returning to the States, Mark served as COO for Entrust. His wife, Kim,
            has partnered with him in all his endeavors, including raising three boys overseas.

            The Love of Christ Children's Center and School is located in an impoverished area of rural Western Kenya in the
            Luucho Village near the town of Bungoma. In this area many children have lost one or both of their parents and
            are with little or no means of support. The Center began in 2007 with a desire to provide hope for a few of
            these
            helpless little ones by supporting their physical and spiritual needs. FBC partnered with Mustard Seed
            Evangelical
            Minitries and Fredrick N. Mulei to begin this project.

            Our family: Zhenya, Lidiya, Matthew and Olivia, are now moved to Kazakhstan, the south part of the country,
            which is the most muslim and traditional. God blessed and we made all paperwork and got permanent residency
            for 10 years. Currently we are serving at the small Kazakh church. All of Kazakh believers that we serve with
            are very first generation of followers of Jesus who came from muslim culture. The biggest need here is not
            information, but living people who would live with them and serve with them shoulder to shoulder and show them.
            Lidiya serves with music and relational ministry with young girls. Lidiya does bakery and it helps to start
            redemptive relationships. Zhenya helps with training kazakh believers, future leaders in what he can.
            10 years of full time ministry in Odessa team equipped us well for God's calling in Asia. Zhenya does bible
            groups,
            discipleship meetings, training guys how to preach, and learns a lot from them as well. We hope to start
            Summer English hiking ministry and looking for people to join us. God has doors in Kazakhstan opened and
            we want to use every second of time He has been giving to us. Please pray for us and leave us message we
            would really like to hear that people are remembering us in their prayers.
